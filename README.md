# Predicting-Rainfall-In-Bangladesh-Time-Series-Analysis-
The data under consideration for this project is the monthly mean value of Bangladesh rainfall.This data spans from 1901 to 1913.The data was gotten from the website link https://www.kaggle.com/yakinrubaiat/bangladesh-weather-dataset. The complete dataset con- tains data both temperature and rainfall data but for this analysis we use the rainfall dataset compiled in monthly averages.The data analysis will mostly be centered around training and predicting our data into the nearest future.To this end we will split our data into 90%/10% , assess the stationarity of dataset (and apply transformations if necessary),decide on reasonable models for the data , fit them and finally predict and compare with the 10%.
